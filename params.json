On the other hand, a section of free publication is available, where students can send messages by Whatsapp, and this is immediately posted on the display.\r\n\r\n[![CampusBoard](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/---7-tt-unGQ/VJ7udfnFgvI/AAAAAAAAAEs/Hgnl1eoQ9N0/w481-h269-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-27%2Bat%2B12.35.16.png)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3s_ouekFFs)\r\n\r\n[![CampusBoard](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-5bHUV2y0www/VKDc3-lwfJI/AAAAAAAAAGA/bS3pWOU5CUc/w601-h338-no/Screen%2BShot%2B2014-12-28%2Bat%2B23.45.34.png)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OukeEUOtZME)\r\n\r\n### Bluetooth Scanner\r\nBluetooth Scanner is an Android Application to scan close bluetooth devices and sent the bluetoothID of the closest device to Campus Board. \r\n\r\n<table border=\"0\">\r\n<tr>\r\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/Campus-Board/bluetoothscanner/raw/master/bin/BluetoothScanner.apk\">Download APK</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/Campus-Board/bluetoothscanner\">Repository</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/Campus-Board/bluetoothscanner/tarball/master\">Download tar.gz</a></td>\r\n<td><a href=\"https://github.com/Campus-Board/bluetoothscanner/zipball/master\">Download zip</a></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPlatform developed by Julio Mendoza and Jael Zela, during the course \"Social Apps and Ubiquitous Computing\", 2014.2 given by PhD.
