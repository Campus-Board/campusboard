In turn, there is a communication between the display and the student, via messages sent through Whatsapp. A student can provide more personal information to the screen by sending a message #cadastrar + full name; or get more information about an event sending #obter + email address. On the other hand, a section of free publication is available, where students can send messages by Whatsapp, and this is immediately posted on the display.\r\n\r\n[![CampusBoard](http://img.youtube.com/vi/a3s_ouekFFs/0.jpg)](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a3s_ouekFFs)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nPlatform developed by Julio Mendoza and Jael Zela, during the course \"Social Apps and Ubiquitous Computing\", 2014.2 given by PhD.
